# A/B Testing on Grocery Online Shops

A/B testing is a user experience research technique. They are tests that allow us to decide which would be better between any two features or strategies. With A/B tests, many features such as being a member of a site, clicking, clicking on advertisements, going to a sale can be tested. In the dataset here, we will observe whether a change made in the web interface of a market increases the number of clicks.
